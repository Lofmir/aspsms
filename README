Ruby ASPSMS is both a ruby library and a command line client for painfree,
UNIX-style interaction with the aspsms.com short message gateways.

Written to conform with the ASPSMS XML Interface Specs 1.91, 2007-12-05.
-   Support for text SMS, show credits, and originator unlocking/testing.
-   Conforms to ASPSMS failure safety recommendations.
-   Delivery status notification is supported by the low-level library
    but not exposed in the easy API nor the command line client.

Configuration is read from ~/.aspsms or [/usr/local]/etc/aspsms by default:

    # ASPSMS configuration
    # mandatory options:
    userkey XYZXYZXYZXYZ
    password y0UrPasSw0rD
    # optional default originator:
    originator +41XXXXXXXXX
    # optional gateway override:
    gateway othergateway:port

Make sure to set sensible permissions (0600 is a good start).
